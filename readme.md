# Ionic Slides

Slides for my Ionic talk at the Fluent Conference, April 21st 2015.

The slide presentation was built as an Ionic app to demonstrate some Ionic features from within the presentation, such as taking a picture of my audience and share it on Twitter using the Camera and Social Sharing plugins.

The app itself was built quickly for this presentation and is definitely work in progress. It's an Ionic version of the Keypoint app I shared before. It's using SwipeView to virtualize the list of slides: there are only three slides in the DOM at any given time.
